# About

I am a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. 

My reserach focuses on combining machine learning and statistical models, with an emphasis on Bayesian methods. While I have past experience in deep learning, my recent work aims to apply these hybrid techniques to complex real-world problems, such as predicting political events and understanding gene perturbation effects.

Before this, I received a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Fudan University in 2023. And I have interned at eBay, Henkel, and Dewu Inc.
